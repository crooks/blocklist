The following command will install the blocklist program:-

	python setup.py install

This needs to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST.in
file for a list of the files that will be installed.

Next, stop being root and login with the system account that will provide the
rab service.  This can be any user you like but remember, you need to pass
messages for this account to the rab program so it's best not to use an account
where you also receive non-rab email.

After installation, a new exectable "rab" will be available.  If this is run
without a configuration file in place, an error will be returned.  A sample
rabrc file can be found in the samples directory of this package.  By default
the program expects to find this in ~/.rabrc.  This can be overriden with the
MIXBLK environment variable.

After creation of the rabrc file, running the program will create all the required
directories and files.  By default these will all be under ~/rab/.

Once everything is working to your satisfaction, you'll need to configure your
MTA (or Procmail) to pass messages to the rab executable.

If you use Procmail, a recipe like this will do it:

:0
| /usr/local/bin/rab


That's it, you're done!
