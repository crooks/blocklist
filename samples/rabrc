## This sample config file lists all the options known to the rab program.
## Each option is commented out and displayed with its default value.  Very few
## of these are expected to be changed by the user but they offer the maximum
## flexibility.  The only options that must be set are 'secret' and
## 'mydomain', both in the 'general'
## section.

## When defining an option, don't forget to uncomment the associated header!

[general]
## The rab only accepts requests that include a properly formatted Subject.
## Without this, every spam email will result in an outbound confirmation
## request to whatever address is in the From header.
#subject = Block Request

## The domain name element of the rab's email address.  If the email address
## is rab@remailer.domain, the domain is remailer.domain.
mydomain = set me to something!

## As above but this is the component on the right-side of the @.  If this
## isn't specified, the program will make a best guess based on the homedir.
#myaddy = rab

## The textual element of the From header that will be used on outbound
## messages.  E.g. Remailer Blocklist <rab@my.domain>.
#myname = Remailer Blocklist

## Currently this option is unsupported by Mixmaster.  When the rab is used
## to create a publicly published blocklist, the content will be hashed to
## prevent harvesting of addresses.
#hash_output = no

## How long should the hash element of challenge responses be trimmed to.  If
## this exceeds 56 (a hex-encoded SHA224 hash), the full length will be
## assumed.
#trim_keys = 20

## Challenge responses are salted with a secret.  This must be defined or the
## program will abort.
secret = set me to something!

#[paths]
## By default, all paths are relative to basedir.  If only basedir is defined,
## everything else will be within it.  If it's not defined, the program will
## assume ~/rab/.
#basedir = /home/rab/rab

## Path to the log directory where the rab.log file will be created.  Take
## note, this log is not automatically rotated.
#log = /home/rab/rab/log

## Path to the lib directory where Berkeley DB files will be created.
#lib = /home/rab/rab/lib

## Path to the etc directory where user-definable files live.
#etc = /home/rab/rab/etc

## The fully-qualified path to where the dest.blk file should be written.
## This is the file that must be presented to Mixmaster.
#outfile = /home/rab/rab/dest.blk

## Paths to the three database files that (by default) reside under the lib
## directory.
#request_db = /home/rab/rab/lib/request.db
#duplicate_db = /home/rab/rab/lib/duplicate.db
#master_db = /home/rab/rab/lib/master.db

## Paths to the four text files used to create email responses to incoming
## block requests.  By default these are all within basedir/etc/.
#request_txt = /home/rab/rab/etc/request.txt
#duplicate_txt = /home/rab/rab/etc/duplicate.txt
#success_txt = /home/rab/rab/etc/success.txt
#failed_txt = /home/rab/rab/etc/failed.txt

#[logging]
## The log level can be error, warn, info or debug.
#level = debug

## The format used by the Python logging library when writing log entries.
#format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s

## The data format used by the Pythong logging library.
#datefmt = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

# vim: tabstop=4 expandtab syntax=config
