<h1>Remailer Abuse Blocklist</h1>
<h2>User Information</h2>
The Remailer Abuse Blocklist (RAB) is a list of email addresses owned by people
who have chosen not to receive messages via the Anonymous Remailer Network.  If
you would like to add your address to this list, there are two ways to do it.
You can send an email to <b>rab@blocklist.mixmin.net</b> from the address you
would like added to the blocklist with a Subject of <b>Block Request</b>, or
you can <a href="http://www.mixmin.net/cgi-bin/rab.cgi"> click here</a> to use
a Web Interface.  Either method will result in you receiving an email asking
you to confirm your request.  This step is very important to prevent abusers
subscribing other people.
<h2>Remailer Operator Information</h2>
For Mixmaster Remailers, support for the rab.blk file is built in.  Operators
only need to download the file from http://www.mixmin.net/rab/rab.blk.  Access
to this file is controlled by userid and password to prevent general access to
the file which could result in spammers harvesting the list.  Please contact
the administrator at admin@mixmin.net if you would like access to it.  If
possible please PGP sign your request so it can be verified as coming from a
Remailer Operator.
